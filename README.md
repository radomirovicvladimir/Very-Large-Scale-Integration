Implementation of the ps2 protocol for the keyboard, where the device is a keyboard with a ps2 serial port, and the host is an Altera CycloneÂ® V FPGA board.
Implementation involves going through all stages of software development for hardware:

Simulation using Verilog and Altera ModelSim
Synthesis using Verilog and Quartus II
Verification using SystemVerilog and QuestaSim
